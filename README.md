# read me on Project2 - Coding Bootcamp Social Media

## Our project

Project 2 is to create a a working full-stack application that is hosted somewhere on the internet. My solution to this is to create a psuedo social media for coding bootcamp attendees called Coding Boottalk It is known as a psuedo social media as while users cannot interact directly with each other thorugh chat and messages, they are able to .

Must haves include features that allow users to sign up, log in and log out. Have two resource tables: one representing a user using the app and one that represents the main functional idea for the app. Include RESTful routes for at least one of my resources. Have semantically clean HTML and CSS. The app must be deployed online and accessible to the public.


## Approach to solving the problem
Step 1: Create two databases, one for user information and one for user posts, image
Step 2: do a log in/log out sign up of my app
Add in the feature to create posts
Step 3: Adjust databases to be more appropriate to my solution.
Step 4: Used INNER JOIN code in SQL to only display the specific user information that is logged in
Step 5: add in a feature to go an individual users page and show their individual posts
Step 6: add in a feature to go another individual users page and show their individual posts

## Flowchart for how the application is planned to flow.

## Technology used
Sinatra, ruby, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Wins
Successfully used multiple languages to develop a web app. 
Invaluable practice for creating a full-stack database backed application.

## Challenges
Our class only had about 8 days of learning about Sinatra and how you can use Ruby to develop full-stack applications. This did require a bit more problem-solving and researching skills to solve certain problems that I might not have learnt in class.
Completing this project over the weekend meant I had limited time with teacher and teaching assistant during the week for assistance with ideas/concepts that might have been beyond my coding abilities. 
Adding css to every individual page further hindered on time constraints.

## Future Features
Adding an extra database to record likes and comments
Adding in extra coloumns and add functionality where users can edit their profile pictures and add in more details like their hometown.
