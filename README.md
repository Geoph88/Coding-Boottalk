# read me on Project2 - Coding Bootcamp Social Media

## Our project

Project 2 is to create a a working full-stack application that is hosted somewhere on the internet. My solution to this is to create a social media for coding bootcamp attendees.
This project will be primarly done using Sinatra, ruby, sql, HTML, CSS and possibly Javascript

Must haves include features that allow users to sign up, log in and log out. Have two resource tables: one representing a a user using the app and one that represents the main functional idea for the app. Include RESTful routes for at least one of my resources. Make sure the HTML and CSS is readable
Will have for my idea: users being able to see information specifically they have posted on their profile. Posts made by an individual user and a like function 
Nice to have: Emojis in the like feature, sound on some buttons


## Approach to solving the problem
Step 1: Create two databases, one for user information and one for user posts, image
Step 2: do a log in/log out sign up of my app
Add in the feature to create posts
Step 3: Adjust databases to be more appropriate to my solution.
Step 4: Research and implement methodoloy to only display the specific user information that is logged in
Step 5: add in a feature to go an individual users page and show their individual posts
Step 6: add in the feature to store those posts for individual user accounts
Step 7: add in a feature to go an individual users page and show their individual posts

## Flowchart for how the application is planned to flow.
